GMRL4

This is a include for SCAR 4 Alpha. Developed by ShadowRecon.

Currently it just has core functions but i plan on adding more content. 


To use this include download and copy all the files and place them in the "Core" 
folder in the SCAR 4 Alpha folder. Then open SCAR 4 and type "uses GMRL;" and you
have access to the functions that are avaiable.
